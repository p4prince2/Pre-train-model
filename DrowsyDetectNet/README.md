# ðŸš— Driver Behavior Detection using YOLOv5 + ResNet-50 + LSTM

This project performs **driver behavior classification** by detecting the driverâ€™s face using **YOLOv5**, extracting high-level features with **ResNet-50**, and analyzing temporal patterns with **LSTM** to predict states like **Focused**, **Sleepy**, **Yawning**, **Distracted**, or **Angry**.
